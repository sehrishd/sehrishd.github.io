                This project was completed over the course of 
                <br> ten weeks in INFO 200, a course focused on 
                <br> information systems and user-centered design 
                <br> at the University of Washington. As a group, 
                <br> we designed courses on Canvas to help college
                <br> students learn the fundamental skills they need 
                <br> to be prepared for the workforce.

                        We created a survey using Google Forms to determine how ready college students
                        feel for the workforce post-grad. We were able to identify our target

                    <p>
                        We conducted two semi-structured interviews with 
                        University of Washington students. Our team 
                        designed a standard interview protocol with three questions
                        that gauged the comfortability of the participants' 
                        life in the workforce post-grad, as well as what 
                        resources the student used at their university. We were able
                        to identify key issues that we needed to address, 
                        which narrowed the scope of our project.

                        and worries that college students had about life post-grad. These
                        were based off of the findings from our surveys
                        and user interviews. Through our research We discovered different
                        challenges that upper-classmen face, which helped us identify
                        specific coursework for our Canvas course. The persona I created

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Primary Features</h3>
                        <p>
                            <span>Feature 1:</span> In-person lectures are integral for relaying 
                            information to college students. We decided to make the 
                            lectures in-person rather than having them asynchronous so 
                            that students actively learn the skills they need while having 
                            the opportunity to get live feedback or ask questions in real 
                            time. In addition, in-person lectures allow the college to keep 
                            track of attendance to better analyze how well the course helps in 
                            career readiness. 
                            <br>
                            <br><span>Feature 2:</span>  In-class discussions facilitate an open, curious environment 
                            where like-minded peers can ask questions or engage with each other as 
                            they go through the course. They also encourage active participation and 
                            collaboration about what is being taught so that the information they 
                            learn in class actually sticks. 
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3>Secondary Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        <span>Relevant Assignments:</span>  Though we did not want these educational classes 
                        to be a burden on students in terms of workload, relevant assignments 
                        pertaining to the lectures and discussions are important so students 
                        can get the practice they need to succeed in the real world. Learning 
                        about skills is one thing, but practicing and engaging with the material
                        is ultimately how career-oriented skills are developed. These 
                        assignments would look like presentations in a public speaking class, 
                        excel spreadsheets in a computer skills class, or a mock interview in a 
                        class that teaches interviewing skills for jobs. 
                        <br>
                        <br><span>Credit/No Credit Grading System:</span>  Similar to a FIG 
                        (first-year interest group) that is already implemented at the University
                        of Washington, these classes would follow a credit/no credit grading 
                        system to ensure they do not add to studentsâ€™ stress with their current
                        workloads (UW First Year Programs 2023). In order to pass the class, 
                        students must complete assignments on time and be actively engaged in 
                        class lectures and discussions. The focus of these classes is on skill 
                        development, not grades or tests. 
                        <br>
                        <br><span>Diversity and Versatility:</span> Career-readiness classes will come in a variety 
                        of forms, times, and sizes. Some will have bigger classes that focus on 
                        vital computer skills, while others will be smaller, more intimate 
                        classes that focus on professional relationship skills such as 
                        interviewing or public speaking. In addition, the classes will be held 
                        at different times and days of the week to accommodate students' 
                        diverse schedules. Whether a student is looking for a small, 
                        collaborative environment or a quick refresh on tools like Figma or 
                        Excel, there will be a class available that fits their needs and schedule.

                        We created wireframes for our entire system with
                        annotations that highlight the main features
                        on each screen. This helped us solidify our course's 
                        main features. These wireframes became the structure
                        for our low-fidelity prototype in the next phase.
